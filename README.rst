This repository hosts a modular Makefile system for Gnu Make. This system has
been used by students in my classes at AUstin Community College. Currently, the
system builds C/C++ and Python projects on Linux, Mac, and WIndows. It also
builds AVR projects using the gcc-avr tools. Read the documentation to
instructions on setting this ssytem up, and building projects.

..  note::

    The project structure is defined for this system, but it flexible enough to
    allow organizing source files in subfolders within the defined top-level
    structure. This setup has proven useful for my students. YMMV!
